# Ex09

# Open shell of debian container

docker run -it --rm debian /bin/bash

# we can now check the debian version [cat /etc/debian_version] and
# update and upgrade all the current packages:

#	->	apt-get update
#	->	apt-get upgrade

# To be able to writte C files we install the text editor nano:

#	->	apt-get install nano

# We write a file named test.c:

#		root@8f6477eb45b1:/# cat test.c
#		#include <unistd.h>
#		int		main(void)
#		{
#				write (1, "Hello world!", 12);
#					return (1);
#		}

# Then, we need to download the package to compile the file:

#	->	apt-get install gcc

# An now, we can compile the test.c like [gcc test.c] and execute the output [./a.out]
#	Hello world!

# To push the file test.c onto a repository we need to get the git package installed:

#	->	apt-get install git

# Next I have created a public repository on my Github, so I'll have to clone
# the repository and configure the git user on my shell:

#	->	git config user.email "cristinafernandezbornay@outlook.com"
#	->	git config user.name "CristinaFdezBornay"

# Now we can clone, add, commit and push the tes.c onto the repository:

#	->	git clone https://github.com/CristinaFdezBornay/test2Docker09.git REPO
#	->	git add test.c
#	->	git commit -m "test.c"
#	->	git push

# Note: when trying to push, we'll be asked about the github Username and password.
