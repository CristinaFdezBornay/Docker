# Ex08
docker run -it --rm alpine /bin/sh

#	Note: the first time we run this command, docker will create the image alpine,
#	on which it will run the container alpine. When we type the command [exit] on
#	the terminal where we're running the container alpine, the container itself will
#	be deleted (we chan check this on other terminal using [docker ps]), but the
#	alpine image will remain.
